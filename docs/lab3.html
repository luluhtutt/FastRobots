                        <h3>Setup</h3>
                        <p>The objective of Lab 3 was to configure the time of flight sensors, which measure distance to
                            aid with obstacle detection and navigation. Lab tasks included soldering components to the
                            Artemis and analyzing data and communication speed.</p>

                            width="900px">

                        <p>Before beginning the lab, I planned out how I was going to wire the components together,
                            which can be seen in the figure above. I decided to place one ToF sensor on the front of the
                            car, and the other on the side of the car. This would be helpful when detecting obstacles,
                            as this placement would allow the robot to see in front and to the side. Because we are
                            using two ToF sensors, they will have the same I2C address by default. In order to measure
                            data using both of the sensors, I used the XSHUT pin on one of the sensors in order to
                            temporarily shut off one of the sensors and change the I2C address of the other.</p>

                        <h3>Soldering</h3>

                        <p>In this lab, I had to solder a connector to the battery, two QWIIC connectors to the
                            ToF sensors, and the XSHUT pin of one of the sensors to one of the GPIO pins on the Artemis.

                        <p>First, I soldered the battery wires to the JST jumper wires. I checked the polarity on the
                            Artemis port to ensure that I was connecting the wires correctly, and then tested the
                            battery by sending BLE data from the Arduino IDE to my computer (using previous lab code).

                        <p>I installed the SparkFun VL53L1X 4m laser distance sensor library in Arduino IDE. Next, I ran
                            Example05_Wire_I2C and found that the address was 0x29. This is different from the address
                            listed in the datasheet, 0x52, because the address is shifted right one bit (0x52 >> 1 =
                            0x29) to account for the rightmost bit being used to identify if data is being read or
                            written.</p>

                        <h3>Three Modes</h3>

                        <p>The ToF sensors have three modes: short, medium, and long. I looked into the pros and cons of
                            each mode, and made a decision about which mode to use.</p>

                        <h4>Discussion</h4>
                        <p><b>Short</b>: The short distance mode has a maximum distance of 1.3 meters and is the least
                            susceptible to ambient light. Overall, this mode has greater accuracy and less noise than
                            the other modes.</p>
                        <p><b>Long</b>: The long distance mode has a maximum distance of 4 meters but is the most
                            susceptible to ambient light.</p>
                        <p><b>Medium</b>: This mode is only available with the Polulu VL53L1X Library, and therefore I
                            did not take this mode into consideration. It has a detection distance between the short and
                            long, and also has noise resistance between short and long.</p>
                        <p>I chose to use short mode for my robot because 1.3 meters is enough distance to detect
                            obstacles, and the better resistance to noise will be greatly beneficial for when I run the
                            car in different settings.</p>

                        <h4>Testing</h4>

                        <p>To test the ToF sensors at short mode, I taped one of the sensors flat on my laptop and used
                            a tape measure to set up different distances from the wall. I decided to take 10 sensor
                            measurements at six different distances:

                        </u>

                        <p>To check the accuracy of the sensors, I plotted the average values I calculated against the
                            actual distances, shown below. From the plot, it can be seen that the measured distance has
                            the greatest deviation from the actual distance at 1524 mm, which is outside of the short
                            mode range. I also observed that the measured values were consistently less than the actual
                            values, which could indicate a human error that remained throughout the data measurements.
                            Because the experiment was manually set up, there was a lot of room for error, such as my
                            laptop screen not being exactly aligned with the measuring tape distance due to a small
                            angle deviation.

                        <p>Next, in order to determine repeatability, I took the standard deviations of the measured
                            sensor data and plotted it against the actual distances, shown in the figure below. Similar
                            to the trend in the plotted average measurements, I observed that the standard deviation was
                            its highest at 1524 mm, which is outside of the short mode range. The other standard
                            deviation values remained close to 1.

                        <p>In order to measure ranging time, I took the start and end times at the beginning and end of
                            each iteration of the data collection loop. I then found the difference and printed that
                            value out to the Serial Monitor. From one test run, I noted that the ranging time hovered
                            around the high-90s (data shown below). These values were higher than I was expecting, which
                            indicated that there was room for optimization within the data collection.</p>

                        <p>The next task was to modify our code to collect data from both sensors instead of just one.
                            To set this up, I switched between LOW and HIGH to set the address of the first sensor. The
                            code to do this is shown below.</p>


                        <div class="code-snippet">

distanceSensor1.setI2CAddress(ADDRESS);
Serial.print("Distance Sensor 1 Address: 0x");
Serial.println(distanceSensor1.getI2CAddress(), HEX);

if (distanceSensor1.begin() != 0) // Begin returns 0 on a good init
{
    Serial.println("Sensor 1 failed to begin. Please check wiring. Freezing...");
    while (1)
        ;

distanceSensor1.setDistanceModeShort();
digitalWrite(XSHUT, HIGH);

                        <p>I also changed the code in the case statement in order to collect data from both sensors
                            instead of just one. I then set up the second ToF sensor, also on my laptop, and collected
                            data to ensure that they were functional. I did this by holding my laptop and rotating it
                            and moving it around near a wall to get varied data.</p>

                            <pre>
distanceSensor1.startRanging();
distanceSensor2.startRanging();

int st = millis();

for(int i = 0; i < array_size; i++)
{

    while (!distanceSensor1.checkForDataReady())    {
        delay(1);
    }
    distance1[i] = distanceSensor1.getDistance();

    while (!distanceSensor2.checkForDataReady())    {
        delay(1);
    }
    distance2[i] = distanceSensor2.getDistance();

    times[i] = millis();

}

int et = millis();

distanceSensor1.clearInterrupt();
distanceSensor1.stopRanging();
distanceSensor2.clearInterrupt();
distanceSensor2.stopRanging();

                        <p>The variables st and et were used for me to check how quickly the loop executed. I ran this
                            implementation, and also measured the time that an empty loop with the same amount of
                            iterations took. As can be seen from the measurements in the photo below, it took 1296 ms to
                            collect 500 sensor readings from each of the sensors (500 iterations of the loop, 1000 total
                            messages). From this measurement, I calculated that it took an average of 2.592 ms per
                            iteration of the loop. This is an immense improvement over the previously measured values of
                            high-90s. The increased speed is due to not having to continuously start, clear, and stop
                            ranging.</p>

                        <h3>Data Collection</h3>

                        <p>I used this optimized code to send over ToF sensor data to my python notebook and
                            graphed that data over time. I used the same Python code logic as in Lab 2.</p>

                        <p>I also printed out the number of messages sent, as well as the time elapsed. These came out
                            to be 1000 messages in 2783 ms, which is a sampling rate of 359.32 messages/second.</p>

                        <p>In comparison to collecting IMU data, using my code from Lab 2, the ToF sensors have a much
                            faster sampling rate. Sending IMU data took 6.112 seconds for 1000 messages, which comes out
                            to be a sampling rate of 163.61 messages/second. This could be due to the IMU sending over
                            more data, as I had to send over measurements from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and also
                            the filtered values.</p>
