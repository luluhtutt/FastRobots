                    <h2>Lab 4: Motors and Open Loop Control</h2>

                    <p><i>02.25.2025 - 03.04.2025</i></p>

                    <section id="setup">
                        <h3>Setup</h3>

                        <p>The objective of Lab 4 was to change from manual to open loop control of the car. To do so,
                            I finished soldering and assembling hardware in the robot, adding on two motor drivers to
                            the components done in past labs. I then wrote code to move the robot around to show an open
                            loop system.</p>

                        <p>I started the lab by planning out how to wire the motor drivers. From the instructions, I
                            knew that there would be connections between the Artemis, the motor drivers, and the 850 mAh
                            battery. You can see my wiring diagram below.</p>

                        <img src="images/lab4_images/hardware_diagram.jpeg" alt="hardware_diagram" class="lab-photo"
                            width="800px">

                        <p>The diagram includes the ToF and QWIIC connect connections from Lab 3, but the motor driver
                            connections can be seen between the Artemis and the motor drivers on the bottom of the
                            diagram. The VIN and GND pins were to be connected, and then connected to the battery. I
                            chose four pins on the Artemis to connect my motor drivers to: A1, A2, A3, and A4. A1
                            connected to BIN2 and AIN2 of one of the drivers, and A2 was then connected to BIN1 and AIN1
                            of the same driver. A3 and A4 were connected similarly to the other driver. For each motor
                            driver, BOUT1 and AOUT1 were connected to a negative motor lead, and BOUT2 and AOUT2 were
                            connected to a positive motor lead. I connected pins together (ie AIN1 and BIN1) by
                            soldering short wires into the pins; I then soldered them to another wire and put heat
                            shrink over the exposed area.</p>

                        <h4>Battery Discussion</h4>
                        <p>The Artemis and motor drivers are powered from separate batteries. This is because the motor
                            drivers and the Artemis have different power requirements and having separate batteries
                            ensured that there is no disruption caused by a shared power supply. This way, using more
                            power on the motor drivers won't affect the Artemis's power.</p>

                        <p></p>

                    <section id="oscilloscope">
                        <h3>Power Supply and Oscilloscope</h3>

                        <p>The first step was to connect one motor driver to the Artemis, and use the power supply and
                            oscilloscope. To set this up, I soldered the motor driver's IN connections to the
                            corresponding pins on the Artemis, as well as one of the GND pins. I used the oscilloscope
                            to probe the OUT connections' signal. I then connected the VIN and the other GND pin to the
                            power supply and set the voltage to 3.7V because that is what our battery provides. The
                            motor driver has a range of 2.7V to 10.8V, so any value within that range would have worked.
                            Below, you can see a picture of my set up.</p>

                        <img src="images/lab4_images/oscilloscope_setup.png" alt="oscilloscope_setup" class="lab-photo"
                            width="600px">

                        <p>In order to see the PWM signal on the oscilloscope, I wrote code that sent PWM signals using
                            analogWrite(). </p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>

    for (int i = 0; i < 255; i++) {
        analogWrite(3, i);
        analogWrite(4, 0);
        analogWrite(1, 255-i);
        analogWrite(2, 0);
        delay(10);
    }
}</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>I captured the following image on the oscilloscope.</p>

                            width="600px">

                        <p>I also captured a video of the signal and the setup.</p>

                        <p>I then tested the other motor driver to confirm that both drivers were functional, which
                            yielded the same results.</p>

                        <h3>Spinning Wheels using Power Supply</h3>

                        <p>The next step was to use the power supply and motor drivers to spin the robot's wheels. To do
                            this, I opened the car up and removed the control PCB, cutting the wires between the board
                            and motors as closely to the board as possible. I also removed the LEDs, as they will no
                            longer be used. I then taped down the other hardware components to keep wires and parts from
                            moving around. Below, you can see a picture of the emptied car with all of the hardware
                            components taped in, except the motor drivers which had not yet been connected.</p>

                        <p>In order to test spinning the wheels, I had to connect the motor drivers to the motor rather
                            than the oscilloscope. I focused on one of the motors first, soldering the OUT pins to the
                            motor's positive and negative wires accordingly. I kept the same power supply setup and
                            wrote code to spin the wheels forwards and backwards to ensure the motor was functional. I
                            wrote some Arduino code to make the wheels spin forward and backward by switching which pin
                            had the non-zero duty cycle.</p>
                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>

{
    delay(1000);

    analogWrite(2, 200);
    analogWrite(3, 0);

    delay(2000);

    analogWrite(1, 0);

    analogWrite(4, 0);
    delay(1000);
}</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>I set the power supply voltage to 3.7V again to test one set of wheels, and then soldered the
                            other motor driver to the other motor and tested that second set of wheels.</p>

                        <p>Next, I used the power supply to power both sets of wheels. Using the power supply's
                            alligator clips, I clipped both VINs together, and both GNDs together.</p>

                        <p>Next, I tested the motor drivers and wheels using the 850 mAh battery. To do this, I soldered
                            the two VIN pins together with the battery's positive lead, and th etwo GND pins together
                            with the battery's negative lead. Then, I connected my charged battery to the other end.</p>

                        <p>I first ran both sets of wheels independently to ensure that they were functional:</p>

                        <p>After testing to make sure that my motors were all working correctly, I started to assemble
                            all of my hardware inside of the car. Below, you can see a diagram of where every component
                            is placed on the car.</p>

                        <p>As of this lab, everything is taped down. I made sure to tape down any wire or parts that
                            were sticking out, but over iterations of testing, some wires would escape their binding. I
                            also decided to put my ToF sensors on the front and back of the car, as I was slightly
                            concerned by the possibility of the wheels causing disturbances in the sensor measurement if
                            it was on the side. I put my Artemis and two motor drivers into the compartment that used to
                            house the PCB board. For one of my motor drivers, I had used longer heat shrink, which
                            caused issues when trying to fit all of wiring into the compartment.</p>

                        <h3>PWM Testing</h3>

                        <p>The next task was to explore the lower limits in PWM value for which the robot moved forward,
                            overcoming the friction of the ground. To do this, I set the car at rest, and increased the
                            PWM value incrementally by 10 until the robot started to move. I noted that the values
                            ranged between 45-55 PWM, the value increasing as time went on. This could be due to using a
                            fresh battery versus a worn one.</p>

                        <p>I also noticed that the range of 45-55 PWM was not enough to turn, as there is rotational
                            friction to overcome in addition. The car started to turn from rest at ~100 PWM.</p>

                        <h3>Calibration</h3>

                        <p>After testing for the lower PWM limits, I moved on to calibrating the wheels. I first wrote
                            some code to move forward and backward, with ample breaks so that I didn't have to chase the
                            car down. I noticed that the car would turn to the left slightly when moving forwards. Below
                            is a video of my car without calibration, where the slight turn can be seen.</p>
