                    <h2>Lab 7: Kalman Filtering</h2>

                    <p><i>03.18.2025 - 03.25.2025</i></p>

                    <p>In this lab, I implemented a Kalman filter algorithm to combine and optimize data from the
                        robot's ToF sensors, which sample slowly. This improved sensor reliability enables more complex
                        maneuvers like precision stopping, flipping, and other various stunts.</p>

                    <section id="collect-data">
                        <h3>Estimating Drag and Momentum</h3>

                        <p>To develop the state space model for our system, I needed to estimate the drag and momentum
                            terms that would populate the A and B matrices. To accomplish this, I performed a step
                            response experimentin which I drove my car towards a wall at a constant motor input speed
                            while logging the motor input values and the ToF sensor output. This method would allow me
                            to characterize the system's dynamic response and extract the parameters needed for modeling
                            the car's motion.</p>

                        <h4>Collecting Data</h4>

                        <p>I first needed to collect data by running my car at a constant PWM while collecting ToF
                            sensor values. To do this, I created two new commands: START_MOVE and STOP_MOVE. These cases
                            would toggle a boolean flag that would simply drive the robot forwards. Turning
                            the move flag on would trigger data collection and movement from the main loop, similar to
                            how PID was implemented in Labs 5 and 6.</p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
case START_MOVE:
{
    set_up_tof();
    data_i = 0;
    current_pwm = 200;
    move = true;
    distanceSensor1.startRanging();

    break;
}

case STOP_MOVE:
{
    num_vars_data_collection = data_i - 1;
    data_i = 0;
    move = false;
    drive(0, 0);
    break;
}</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>On the python end, I had a notification handler to gather data, similar to previous labs.
                            Using the ToF distance values, I wrote code to obtain and graph velocity values.</p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
for i in range(len(kf_time)):
    if i == 0:
        kf_vel.append(0)
    else:
        dt = kf_time[i] - kf_time[i-1]
        ddist = kf_distance[i-1] - kf_distance[i]
        if (dt != 0 and ddist != 0):
            kf_vel.append(float(ddist / dt))</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>I tested several values of PWM when running these initial tests by changing the current_pwm
                            variable. I first started with 165, which resulting in the following ToF, PWM, and velocity
                            graphs. I noticed a somewhat steady state around a velocity of 300 mm/s, and decided to
                            continue testing different PWM values to see if I could reach a steady state at a faster
                            speed.</p>

                        <p>I also tested a PWM value of 155 because I noticed that I wasn't getting many data points,
                            but every time I ran this value, I wouldn't be able to get a steady state speed.</p>

                        <p>I finally used a PWM value of 200, as this is the max PWM value I clip my motor drivers to.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Calculating Drag and Momentum</h4>

                        <p>At this control speed, I decided to use the last few points to determine my steady state
                            speed, as they were relatively close compared to the other logged velocities. I took the
                            average of the last three data points to get my steady state velocity, and also found the
                            speed at 90% rise time.</p>

                        <img src="images/lab7_images/ss_calc.png" alt="pi_error" class="lab-photo" width="350px">

                        <p>When graphing the velocity at 90% rise time, I estimated the time to be around the 3rd last
                            point. The steady state velocity, 90% velocity, and the rise time can all be seen graphed on
                            top of the velocity graph for a PWM of 200.</p>

                        <p>I then used the steady state speed and ride time to calculate the drag and mass of the car

                        <p>The next step was to determine the matrices A and B</p>
                        <p>
                            \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & -\frac{d}{m} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            \end{bmatrix}\)
                        </p>

                        <p>In order to implement a Kalman filter for discrete time readings, I discretized A and B: </p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
Ad = np.eye(n) + dt * A
Bd = dt * B</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>I then had to define the observation matrix C, and initalize the vector x from the first ToF
                            distance readings from the data collection earlier.</p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>

uss = 1

x = np.array([[tof[0]], [0]])</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>Finally, I had to calculate the process and sensor noise covariances, which were dependent on
                            the sampling time dt or sensor variance dx. I found my ToF sampling time to be 0.09 seconds,
                            or 90 ms, and found my dx value to be 20 mm from the data sheet. I then used these sigma
                            values to define the covariances and diagonal covariance matrices, Sigma_u and Sigma_z.</p>

    sigma_m = C.dot(sigma_p.dot(C.transpose())) + sigma_z

                        </div>

                        <p>I then plotted the results of the Kalman filter with the ToF raw values.</p>

                        <p>The Kalman Filter model fits the ToF readings decently well, which means that the variable
                            values that I found were good estimates. I also played around with different values of dx to
                            test the affects of Sigma_z, which represented the mistrust in sensor readings. I tried out
                            values of 25 mm (left) and 50 mm (right), as the datasheet also had the value of 25, and I
                            also wanted to test a very high value.</p>

                        <p>I found that a dx value of 20 mm was good, as the Kalman filter for 25 mm and 50 mm was too

                        <h3>Implementing KF on the Robot</h3>

                        <p>After implementing the Kalman filter in Python on one set of ToF data, the next task was to
                            implement the filter in Arduino. This way, the KF could supplement the raw ToF values,
                            allowing the car to speed up and stop 1 ft from the wall.</p>

                        <p>My approach to this code was to closely follow my Python implementation for the Kalman
                            filter. I first added the variables that I had found earlier:</p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">

                        <p>I changed my PID implementation in the main loop to use the estimated values instead of the
                            raw ToF values:</p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
kf(kf_speed, kf_distance, distance1);
pwm = pid(kf_distance, target);</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>I had also changed my Lab 5 PID code to use Kp, Ki, and Kd, but I had to tune it further
                            during this lab.</p>

                        <p>On the Python end, I graphed the raw and estimated values, as well as the PWM and difference
                            between the raw and estimated values.</p>

                        <p>I noticed that the estimated values were not very far off from the raw values. The areas with
                            the most difference were when the robot was oscillating between back and forth, and the
                            original distance estimate at time 0. (Note: I labeled the second graph wrong and corrected
                            it in preview, which is why the text "KF" looks strange).</p>

                        <p>The PWM values graphed above bring up some issues I had with the PID implementation. I
                            originally noticed that my car would stop a little bit further than 1 ft, but the motor
                            drivers would still be trying to move forwards. I came to the conclusion that this was a
                            result of fighting the friction of the ground, and thus shifted all PWM values up by 20 in
                            order to overcome this friction. As a result, the PWM oscillations damped to a value of 20
                            instead of 0.</p>

                            from the wall.</p>

                        <h3>Notes and References</h3>
                        <p>Due to the lab handout saying that we had to implement KF on the robot "if we had time", I
                            thought it was optional until the professor posted an announcement the night before,
                            clarifying that it was required. I didn't have sufficient time to properly tune and test
                            the robot. As a result of the limited time and repeatedly having to charge my battery, I
                            wasn't able to tune the Kd parameter optimally. The graphs and video show that it oscillates
                            before reaching the goal distance, which I suspect is a result of the Kd parameter not being
                            tuned enough and also the inconsistency of my battery.</p>

                        <p>I worked with Jennie Redrovan and Sana Chawla on this lab, discussing how to implement the
                            Kalman Filter. I also referenced Stephen Wagner's Lab 7 Report from last year.</p>
