                    <h2>Lab 1: Artemis & Bluetooth</h2>

                    <p><i>01.21.2025 - 01.28.2025</i></p>

                    <h3>Objective</h3>

                    <p>Lab 1 is split into two parts, 1A and 1B. The overall objective of this lab was to set up and
                        familiarize myself with the Arduino IDE and the Artemis board. Lab tasks included programming
                        the board, reading & writing serial messages over USB, using the onboard temperature sensor and
                        microphone, and communicating between my computer (Jupyter notebook) and the Artemis board
                        through Bluetooth.</p>

                    <h3>Lab 1A</h3>

                    <p>I first installed Arduino IDE and made sure that it was updated to the most recent version. I
                        also followed the set up instructions to install the correct board and libraries. After hooking
                        up the Artemis board to my computer and selecting the correct Board and Port, I moved on to the
                        tasks.</p>

                    <h4>Example 1: Blink</h4>
                    <p>The first example code we ran was blink, which made the LED on the board to turn on and off. I
                        was able to upload and run the code with no issues. You can see the board executing the
                        program below:</p>

                        allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <h4>Example 2: Serial</h4>
                    <p>I then uploaded and ran the next example, Serial. This code allowed me to type characters in the
                        Serial monitor and then receive the same input characters as outputs, also in the Serial
                        monitor.</p>

                        allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <h4>Example 3: Analog Read</h4>
                    <p>The third example file was analogRead, which utilized the on board temperature sensor. The
                        temperature measurements were outputted to the serial monitor, and I tested the sensor by
                        holding the board in my hand to warm it up. There was not a super noticeable change, perhaps
                        because my hands at the time weren't particularly warm. However, as seen in the video below, the
                        temperature did increase when I held the board.</p>

                        allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <h4>Example 4: Microphone Output</h4>
                    <p>The last example had me test the microphone on the Artemis board. Similarly to the temperature
                        reading in example 3, the frequency measurements were outputted to the Serial Monitor. I tested
                        whistling, and the frequency increased accordingly.</p>

                    <h4>Blink & Microphone (additional task for 5000-level students)</h4>
                    <p>I also decided to do the graduate level task, which was to create a program that would make the
                        Artemis board blink the LED only when it detected a musical “C” note. I did this by creating
                        a new file, and referencing the Blink and Microphone Output examples to run the blink code only
                        when the detected frquency was in the "C" note range. The code for this task can be seen on the
                        github repository (link).</p>
