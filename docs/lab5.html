                        <h3>Prelab</h3>

                        <p>In this lab, a PID controller is implemented to achieve closed-loop control. The controlled
                            state was speed, and a ToF sensor was used to ensure the robot stopped at a
                            set distance from the wall. </p>

                        <h4>PID Overview</h4>

                        <p>A PID controller consists of three key parts:</p>
                        <li>Proportional (P): responds to the present error</li>
                        <li>Integral (I): accounts for the accumulation of past errors</li>
                        <li>Derivative (D): predicts future error by using the rate of change</li>

                        <p>These parts together form the PID control equation, which I took from Lecture 7: </p>

                        <img src="images/lab5_images/pid_equation.png" alt="pid_equation" class="lab-photo"
                            width="350px">

                        <p>This equation calculates the PID input value ùë¢(ùë°) using the error ùëí(ùë°), which represents
                            the difference between the desired and current values. In this lab, the error corresponds to
                            the difference between the target distance from the wall (1 ft) and the robot‚Äôs actual
                            distance. The resulting PID input value directly influences the robot‚Äôs speed.

                            Proportional control scales the error by a constant K_p, providing an immediate response.
                            Integral control accumulates past errors by integrating over time and multiplying by K_i,
                            helping to eliminate steady-state error. Derivative control predicts future error changes by
                            computing the rate of change of the error and multiplying by K_d, improving system
                            stability.</p>

                    <section id="bluetooth">
                        <h4>Bluetooth</h4>

                        <p>Before starting the lab tasks, I modified my code to make data collection and debugging
                            easier. As such, I added a boolean flag, pid_on, that would keep track of whether or not to
                            use the pid controller. I also added three more command types: START_PID, STOP_PID, and
                            GET_PID_DATA. These would be easily callable using Bluetooth, and helped running the car and
                            collecting data much more convenient.</p>

                        <p>The START_PID case set pid_on to true and set up the tof sensors, which then would allow the
                            pid calculation as well as data collection to begin in the main loop. The STOP_PID case sets
                            the pid_on flag to false and stops the car.</p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
case START_PID:
{
    set_up_tof();

    pid_i = 0;
    start_time = (float)millis();
    error_sum = 0;
    distanceSensor1.startRanging();

    pid_on = true;
    break;
}</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>The third case that I added was GET_PID_DATA, which returns time, distance, and pwm. I
                            implemented this in the same way as in previous labs.</p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
case GET_PID_DATA:
{
    for (int i = 0; i < num_data_msgs; i++)
    {
        tx_estring_value.clear();
        tx_estring_value.append(times[i]);
        tx_estring_value.append(",");
        tx_estring_value.append(distance1_data[i]);
        tx_estring_value.append(",");
        tx_estring_value.append(pwm_data[i]);
        Serial.println(tx_estring_value.c_str());
        tx_characteristic_string.writeValue(tx_estring_value.c_str());
    }
    break;
}</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>The last part of the bluetooth code was on the Python end, where I would receive the data to
                            plot and analyze. I used a notification handler similar to the ones from previous labs.</p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
data = ""
timeArr = [] 
tof_pid = [] 
pwm_pid = []

def notification_handler_pid(uuid, array):
    data = ble.bytearray_to_string(array)
    if "," in data: 
        arr = s.split(",")
        else:
            timeArr.append(int(arr[0]))
            tof_pid.append(float(arr[1]))
            pwm_pid.append(float(arr[2]))</pre>
                        </div>

                    <section id="kp">
                        <h3>Proportional Control</h3>

                        <p>I began my PID implementation by first only using proportional control. To better organize my
                            code, I
                            made a function that used PID to update the pwm value. The code below shows just the P
                            component.
                        </p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
int pid(float dist, float target_dist)
{
    float current_dist = dist;
    float error = dist - target_dist;

    float pwm = kp * error;

    if (pwm > 0)
    {
        if (pwm > max_speed)
            pwm = max_speed;

        return pwm;
    }
    else if (pwm < 0)
    {
        if (pwm < -max_speed)
            pwm = -max_speed;

        return pwm;
    }

    return pwm;
}</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>I added a max_speed value, set to ~100, and clipped the pwm values so they wouldn't exceed
                            that speed. This pid function is used in the main loop, updating the time, pwm, and tof
                            arrays whenever new ToF readings were available. </p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
if (pid_on)
{
int distance1;
int pwm;

if (distanceSensor1.checkForDataReady())
{
    distance1 = distanceSensor1.getDistance();
    distanceSensor1.clearInterrupt();
    distanceSensor1.stopRanging();
    distanceSensor1.startRanging();

    pwm = pid(distance1, target);

    if(curr_time - start_time > 20000)
    {
        pid_on = false;
        drive(0, 0);
    }

    if (pid_i < num_data_msgs)
    {
        distance1_data[pid_i] = distance1;
        pwm_data[pid_i] = pwm;
        times[pid_i] = (float)millis();
        pid_i++;
    }
}
if (pwm > 0)
{
    drive(1, pwm);
}
else if (pwm < 0)
{
    drive(-1, pwm);
}
else
{
    drive(0, 0);
}</pre>
                        </div>

                        <p>I first check if the pid_on flag is true - this code is looped through repeatedly, and will
                            only run the pid code if the pid_on flag has been set to true. Then, I check if the sensor
                            placed at the front of my car (sensor 1) is ready to take a reading. If it is, I take the
                            sensor reading and pass it into the previously mentioned pid function, which returns a
                            corresponding PWM value. I implemented a timing failsafe that stops the pid control after 20
                            seconds, in the case that Bluetooth disconnects and I am unable to call STOP_PID. I then
                            check if the pid index is within the data array bounds before appending it to the arrays.
                            Using the calculated PWM value, I either move the car foward, backwards, or have it stop
                            (when the pwm is 0, the target has been reached and thus the car doesn't move). </p>

                        <p>I start off by using a Kp value of 0.05, and the car stopped at the target distance without
                            oscillating.</p>

                        <iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://youtube.com/embed/46oZUAeEK9o"
                            title="Oscilloscope" frameborder="0"

                            allowfullscreen></iframe>

                        <p>I tested this Kp value in different areas to make sure that it would work on different kinds
                            of floors, and confirmed that my robot was able to stop 1 foot away without oscillating
                            noticeably. You can see this also in the ToF and error plots from one of the runs' data
                            collection:</p>

                        <img src="images/lab5_images/05_tof.png" alt="05_tof" class="lab-photo" width="600px">
                        <img src="images/lab5_images/05_error.png" alt="05_error" class="lab-photo" width="600px">

                        <p>In the ToF graph, the red dotted line is the target distance (1 foot). As the plots show,
                            there is basically no oscillation once the robot reaches the target distance. The error
                            graph on the right follows a similar trend, as once it reaches an error value of zero, it
                            doesn't oscillate further than that. I took this to mean that 0.05 is a good value for my P
                            controller.</p>

                        <p>I also plotted the PWM values for this run:</p>
                        <img src="images/lab5_images/05_pwm.png" alt="05_pwm" class="lab-photo" width="600px">
                        <p>My robot starts off at a PWM near the max, and slows down until it reaches the target.
                            Because there was no backwards movement for this run, there are no negative PWM values
                            shown.</p>

                        <p>While I was pretty lucky in getting a good Kp value on my first attempt, I also tested a Kp
                            value of 0.2.</p>

                        <img src="images/lab5_images/kp0-2_tof.png" alt="kp0-2_tof" class="lab-photo" width="600px">

                        <p>As predicted, this run had the car moving back and forth to reach the target distance.</p>

                        <h3>Extrapolation</h3>

                        <p>The next step was to analyze the sampling rate of the ToF sensors, and of the PID loop. Using
                            a similar strategy to Lab 3's sampling rate calculations, I took measurements of both. I
                            determined that the PID loop without taking sensor measurements took ~7 ms, which is a
                            frequency of 142.86 Hz. The ToF sampling period was 40 ms, or ~25 Hz. Because the ToF sensor
                            readings update at a lower frequency, I implemented extrapolation to estimate the robot's
                            position in between readings bcased on the last two sensor readings.</p>

                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>This lab presented several hardware related struggles, but ultimately gave me a better
                            understanding of PID control. I had a lot of issues with my battery, as it would charge for
                            long periods of time but only last enough time for a couple of runs. I attempted to use my
                            friend's battery, and it was perfectly functional. I had to adjust the placement of my
                            forward facing ToF sensor, as it was slightly tilted down and thus made my car stop whenever
                            it touched the ground, but run properly in the air. My ToF sensor would also often sense
                            things in front of it when there was nothing close by.</p>
